# [I-Am-Bored App](https://i-am-bored-app.web.app/)
Have you been boring recently? Do you feel you can do something different with your free time, but you don't know what yet? This app was made for you!

Inspired in [The Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/), The I-Am-Bored App is a place where you can find excellent ideas for new projects. Every recommendation is divided into 4 different categories: **type**, which refers to the type of the activity; **participants**, the number of people that the activity could involve; **price**, a factor describing the cost of the event with zero being free; and **accessibility**, a factor describing how possible an event is to do with zero being the most accessible. Try this app out! Go and take a look!

P.S.: Designed for mobile devices. Tablet and desktop version coming soon!
